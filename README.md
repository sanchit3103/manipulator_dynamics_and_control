# Dynamics and Force control of a 3 DOF manipulator with PID stiffness controller

<p align="justify">
This project focuses on modelling the dynamics of a 3 DOF robotic manipulator using Euler-Lagrange methods. The dynamical equations of motion are formulated in terms of joint positions, velocities, accelerations, inertia, Coriolis/centrifugal and gravity terms. The robot is modelled using the Peter Corke robotics toolbox in Python. Designed to be a pick and place robot, a PID based stiffness controller is implemented to enable and simulate the robot reaching four corners of a box in Cartesian space with minimal overshoot, while holding a payload.
